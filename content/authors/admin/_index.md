My core passion is to help create as many High-Performance Digital Organizations as possible. Over the past 15+ years I have gained valuable knowledge, skills and experience in the academic, consulting, start-up, and corporate world. Central themes have always been 'realizing more value with IT', better aligning 'Business' with 'IT' and smartly investing in the right (technical) knowledge and skills. In this era of digital disruption these themes are more important than ever. I am convinced that organizations need to invest heavily in organizational and digital transformation in order for them to remain relevant, successfull, or even survive.

I love sharing knowledge, coaching and mentoring people, getting inspired by smart and passionate people, and solving complex problems. Via my company Rethink Digital I am available for consulting and coaching engagements or for workshops and lectures.
