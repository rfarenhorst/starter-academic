Throughout my 15+ year career I have focused on helping organizations getting more value out of IT. Often this has not much to do with changing or investing in technology. It is almost always primarily about culture, leadership, and organizational transformation. In my view, in these disruptive times, digital-driven innovation and organizational transformation is urgent and a necessity for organizations to survive. 

With my company Rethink Digital, I help organizations rethink the way they do digital and help them to transform into High-Performance Digital Organizations. This typically involves challenging the status quo, providing guidance in defining a new (digital) strategy and organizational/technical future state, and coaching and training of the leadership and transformation teams.

Over the past years I have built a career in academia, consulting, training, and senior management. I have been in the luxurious position to have worked with great, knowledgeable and experienced leaders, experts, researchers, consultants, coaches, and trainers worldwide. It is my passion to share all this knowledge and experience as broadly and effective as possible. I am committed to help shape and continuously expand the body of knowledge on digital transformation, organizational transformation and digital leadership. To make as much positive impact as possible, I will spend as much time as possible to connect to fellow leaders and experts in the field, help share their stories, and stimulate knowledge sharing by building a community or practice.
