My core passion is to help create as many High-Performance Digital Organizations as possible. Over the past 15+ years I have gained valuable knowledge, skills and experience in the academic, consulting, start-up, and corporate world. Central themes have always been 'realizing more value with IT', better aligning 'Business' with 'IT', creating High-Performance cultures, and smartly investing in (digital) talent management for both leaders and specialists. In this era of digital disruption these themes are more important than ever. I am convinced that organizations need to invest heavily in organizational and digital transformation in order for them to remain relevant, successfull, or even survive.

I love sharing knowledge, coaching and mentoring people, getting inspired by smart and passionate people, and solving complex problems. With my company Rethink Digital I am striving to make as much positive impact as I can. I focus on speaking, training, coaching, taking leadership and (sr.) management roles, and sharing knowledge via all available online and offline channels.
