A lecture or keynote presentation by Rik usually lasts an hour. However, sometimes there is a need for a longer duration or more intensive interaction. Then a workshop or training is probably a better alternative. 

Workshops usually last 2 to 3 hours and are designed together with the client to give best results. Training by Rik is also possible, both classroom or online, varying from one or two-day trainings, to, for example, half a day per month for six months in a row. Please get in touch to discuss this. Typical subjects Rik provides workshops and trainings on include leadership, culture, digital transformation, organizational transformation, Agile & DevOps, and (enterprise) IT architecture. Rik is a certified author and trainer of the DevOps Agile Skills Association (DASA).
