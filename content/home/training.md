A lecture or keynote presentation by Rik usually lasts an hour. However, sometimes there is a need for a longer duration or more intensive interaction. Then a workshop or training is probably a better alternative. Workshops usually last 2 to 3 hours and are designed together with the client to give best results. 

Rik can also be booked for providing a 1 or 2-day training (online or on-premise). Tailor-made in-company variations (e.g. half a day per month for six months in a row) are possible as well. Please [get in touch](#contact) to discuss the possibilities!

Typical subjects Rik provides workshops and trainings on include digital leadership, creating high-performance organizations, organizational and digital transformation, Agile & DevOps (at scale), and (enterprise) IT architecture. Rik is also a founding member, courseware developer and, certified master trainer of the DevOps Agile Skills Association (DASA).
