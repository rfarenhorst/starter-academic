I have more than 15 years of experience in the IT domain, and have built a rich leadership, management, consultancy and academic track record. I am open to challenging non-executive & executive board positions or temporary leadership roles to help organizations transform to the new digital normal. I can also be [contacted](#contact) for leadership coaching or advisory, to help leaders and management teams to boost their digital and organizational transformation. 

#### Senior leadership experience (executive / non-executive)

I am currently Directeur Digital at [Ordina](http://ordina.nl). I am responsible for Ordina's digital transformation and consulting business. In addition, I have a leading role in Ordina's organizational transformation to further improve and integrate our business propositions. Through these propositions we will become an even more premium brand and authority in the Benelux for both our customers and employees.

As CIO of Transavia airlines, I was responsible for the Digital Innovation and IT Run budget and was leading the digital and organization transformation agenda. I put emphasis on the organizational transformation required to turn Transavia into an innovative airline and high-performance digital organization (culture, people, processes, technology) that creates tanglible value for both its passengers and employees. That involved creating end-to-end responsible product teams, getting the right people on the bus, investing in talent management, modernizing strategic portfolio management, changing key governance structures to be compatible with Agile and DevOps principles and practices, improving the application and infrastructure landscapes, and coaching the leadership teams of both IT and business to adjust to the new way of working.   

I am currently a supervisory board member of Hotelschool the Hague, a single sector University of Applied Science in the Netherlands offering a Bachelor's degree and an MBA in Hotel and Hospitality Management. HTH is consistently ranked as one of the top 5 hospitality schools worldwide. To help retain this position, I help HTH with her digital and organizational transformation of both the curricula and the school's day-to-day operations.  

During my board member position of the CIO platform Netherlands (2019-2020), I spearheaded the 'Transformation, People, & Organization theme' to promote knowledge sharing among its 130+ member organizations. I helped expand the body of knowledge and create a community of practice on what leaders should do to help their organizations benefit from all digital transformation opportunities.

I am chairman of the Enterprise Leadership Forum of the [DevOps Agile Skills Association (DASA)](https://www.devopsagileskills.org/). My aim is to inspire and bring together executive leadership peers and professionals on a **global scale** to help as many organizations as possible to profit from digital and organizational transformation. To this end I organize global and local events, and frequently connects to leaders worldwide to harvest and share valuable success and failure stories from all kinds or organizations and perspectives.
